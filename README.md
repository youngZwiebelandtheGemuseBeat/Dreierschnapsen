### Dreierschnapsen

## Installation

This game is a command line application still and now ready for testing, 
therefore ino drivers or installing is required.

## Configuration

Except a seed to set up a pseudo random number for playing/testing the game 
there is nothing that might have to be configured by a player.
Lately I added the feature to change players' names. Enter "default" to use
the following default names. "Seppi, Hansi, Lissi".

## Usage

Double click the Beta_Dreierschnapsen_20220726_windows.exe/.out and get started 
with playing/testing. At the first time having played/tested the game a second 
file called DreierschnapsenBlackBox.log can be found in the same directory. 
Please do not delete it. It contains informations about each "Bummerl" played
for further testing, servicing and most importantly "finishing" the backend of 
this very game.
Please do not move the .exe, .out or the .log data from its directory.
